*From Swift basics to advanced iOS architectures: A complete learning path.*

## ✨ About This Project  
Welcome to **iOS Development 0 to 100** - A curated collection of Swift Playgrounds, quizzes and practical Xcode projects designed to take you from Junior to Senior iOS developer.  

This material is the result of years of mentoring junior developers, teaching Swift and reviewing fundamental to advanced concepts.  

I use it personally to **sharpen my skills** and I mentor others through the same material to help them **master iOS development step by step**.

## 🧭 How to Use  
1. Start with the **Playgrounds**, in numerical order (`Playground01`, `Playground02`, …).  
   - Each Playground starts with a **summary page** and individual pages for each topic.  
   - Use the **navigation buttons** (`[Previous]`, `[Next]`) at the bottom and top of each page.  
   - Turn on **"Render Documentation"** in Xcode for the best reading experience.  
2. Do the **Mini Challenges** at the end of each page to reinforce learning.  
3. Take the **Final Quiz** at the end of each Playground to test your knowledge.  
4. After Playgrounds, move into the **Xcode Projects** (coming soon). These cover real-world iOS concepts:  
   - Architectures (MVC, MVP, MVVM, VIPER, etc.)  
   - UIKit vs SwiftUI feature implementations  
   - App lifecycle differences  
   - Unit tests, UI tests, snapshot tests  
   - Localization (strings files and dictionary-based)  
   - Security (Keychain, safe coding practices)  
   - Persistence (SwiftData, UserDefaults, File System)  
   - Networking and async patterns

### 🟦 Playground 01: Swift Basics  
- Introduction  
- Data types: `Int`, `Double`, `Float`, `Bool`, `String`

- Collections:  
  - Arrays  
  - Dictionaries  
  - Sets  
  - Tuples (separate from collections)  
- Conditionals: `if/else`, `switch`  
- Loops: `while`, `repeat-while`, `for-in`, ranges (`...`, `..<`, `stride`)  
- Control transfer statements: `break`, `continue`, `fallthrough`, `guard`  

### 🟩 Playground 02: Optionals & Functions  
- Optionals:  
  - Declaring optionals (`?`)  
  - Forced unwrap (`!`)  
  - Optional binding (`if let`, `guard let`)

  - Optional chaining  
- Functions:  
  - Parameters & return values  
  - Default parameters  
  - `inout` parameters  
  - Functions as types  
  - `typealias`  
- Closures:  
  - Basic closure syntax  
  - Trailing closures  
  - Escaping closures (`@escaping`)  
  - Discardable results (`@discardableResult`)  
- Higher-order functions: `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `compactMap`, `flatMap`  

### 🟨 Playground 03: Structs, Enums & Properties  
- Structs (value types) vs Classes (reference types)  
- Enums: simple, raw values, associated values, pattern matching with `switch`  
- Properties:  
  - Stored properties  
  - Computed properties
  - Pure Functions
  - Property observers (`willSet`, `didSet`)  
  - Getters and setters  
- Access control: `open`, `public`, `internal`, `fileprivate`, `private`  
- `static` keyword (properties & methods)  
- Extensions  

### 🟧 Playground 04: Object-Oriented Programming  
- Classes & objects  
- Initializers and deinitializers  
- Encapsulation (access control recap)  
- Inheritance  
- Polymorphism  
- Method overriding vs overloading  
- Protocols (introduction)

### 🟥 Playground 05: Design Patterns  
- Introduction to design patterns  
- Creational: Singleton, Factory  
- Structural: Decorator, Adapter  
- Behavioral: Observer, Strategy, Coordinator/Router  
- Bonus: Builder, Proxy  

### 🟪 Playground 06: Code Standards & Conventions  
Based on Google’s Swift Style Guide + Apple’s API Design Guidelines  
- Source file basics: file names, imports, comments, extensions  
- General formatting:  
  - Column limit  
  - Braces  
  - One statement per line  
  - Line wrapping  
  - Horizontal whitespace & alignment  
  - Vertical whitespace  
- Naming conventions:  
  - UpperCamelCase (types)  
  - lowerCamelCase (functions/vars)  
  - Global constants  
- Programming practices:  
  - Avoid force unwraps & force casts  
  - Use `guard` for early exits  
  - `for-where` loops  
  - Pattern matching  
  - Playground literals  
- Documentation with Swift Markup & DocC  

### 🟫 Playground 07: Programming Paradigms  
- Imperative Programming (UIKit step-by-step style)  
- Object-Oriented Programming (recap)  
- Protocol-Oriented Programming (POP):  
  - Protocol extensions, protocol inheritance  
- Functional Programming (FP):  
  - Immutability  
  - Pure functions  
  - Higher-order functions  
- Declarative Programming:  
  - SwiftUI  
  - Auto Layout constraints  
- Reactive Programming:  
  - Combine basics (`@State`, `@Binding`, `@Published`)  
  - Observables, publishers, subscribers  

### Projects (Work in Progress 🚧)  
- **Project 1:** High-level iOS concepts, architectures and lifecycle  
- **Project 2:** UIKit, SwiftUI and bread-and-butter components (tables, collections, pickers, etc.)
